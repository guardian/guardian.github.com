The Digital Department at the Guardian is responsible for distributing the journalism of the Guardian online via our <a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> and our mobile applications.

## Everything we do is in pursuit of a cause that is greater than ourselves.

### Empowering journalism

We build products that make it easier for journalists to publish informative and delightful stories.

### Coding in the open

We are commited to being [transparent in our work](/developers/projects), making as much as we can public.

### Using the best tool for the job

We mostly [program in Scala and Javascript](/developers/technology.html), but we use the best tool that solves the problem.

### Moving fast

We spend our energy on the right things, shipping code and then rapidly iterating on it.
